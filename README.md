If u r here for the first time - this is a little endeavor I am embarking on bc I think it is such a special thing to chat w complete strangers that you wouldnâ€™t otherwise talk to in your day to day life!!

Every once in a while, Iâ€™ll be sitting in a public space (cafe, park, etc.) with a sign inviting people to ~come sit with me~~ ðŸ¥°

This started when I had just graduated + was unemployed however now I have a big girl job so Iâ€™ve slowed down a bit BUT MORE CONTENT SHALL COME I PROMISE

This has also become my event-hosting account for my 2025 (aka 2020-THRIVE) one-event-a-month endeavor ðŸ¦‘ðŸ¦‘
