We have been living in a genocide for more than 21 months. The bombing, killing and massacres do not stop.\n\n  Every day they kill more than 100 children and women. We are suffering a lot. We do not have food or drink and we do not have anything. We left our homes and did not take anything with us. They destroyed our homes, our dreams and our memories. Here in Gaza we die 100 times a day. We could die at any moment. We are now living in famine. We do not have food or anything to eat. I wanted to complete my studies and achieve my dreams, but the war came and destroyed everything. Now I ask you all to help me and my family to get food and water.\n\n  We need $100 a day to be able to provide for food and supplies. Please help us reach this goal for us so we can have the supplies we need to survive.\n\n\nGaza Sunbirds\nA Palestinian para-cycling team providing community-led aid in Gaza, including distributing essential aid, engaging in activities with youth, and managing a refugee camp.\n\n\nPalestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF)\nProvides urgent aid, including medical aid, treatment, food, water, and necessities for affected families. PCRF also focuses on rebuilding healthcare facilities and funding trauma counseling and mental health services to foster healing in the community.\n\n\nWorld Central Kitchen\nWCK has served more than 145 million meals in Gaza and is seeking to rapidly scale up production to an unprecedented one million hot meals a day."
